This is a sample code for the use of encryption and decryption if you are creating
an app on SSG-WSG Developer Portal (https://developer.ssg-wsg.sg).

In the sample HTML form, it takes in an encryption key and original string and
returns an encrypted string. After which, decryption can be done based on the
encrypted string to return the original string.
